# 📈 AI Automated Trading System – LSTM Stock Direction Predictor

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered automated trading system** that predicts the **direction of stock price movement** (upward or downward) using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**.  
The goal is to assist traders in making better decisions by identifying potential trends from historical price data.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series forecasting
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly for candlestick charts

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (normalization, sequence generation)
- LSTM model for trend direction classification
- Prediction of **next-day stock movement** (Up / Down)
- Visualization of actual vs predicted trends
- Modular code for easy extension (e.g., more indicators, RL-based strategies)
